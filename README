wallsan is a python (3.x) program that changes wallpapers automatically
every 'x' seconds from a given directory

The program is written for mate-desktop but can be quickly altered to accomodate
other desktop environments

The program consists of two files
1. wallsan.py 
	which is supposed to be initiated at computer startup
	and start changing the wallpapers

2. commander.py - GUI
	This is used to update the config file for wallpaper directory
	and time interval
	It can pause and resume wallsan.py
	Starting commander.py automatically checks if wallsan.py is running
	and if isn't the case, wallsan.py is started
	
3. wallChangerPipe - The above processes communicate through a named pipe.
	The pipe is automatically created in the same directory as that of the
	commander.py and wallsan.py

4. config.ini - Configuration is stored in config.ini file, which also 
	stores whether the program is paused or running.It is automatically 
	generated once the wallsan.py is initiated

All the above four files reside in the same directory


Further Improvements:
1. The GUI is not refined. It is upto the task but ugly. This could be improved.
2. At present it supports only mate-desktop. This could be extended to other
	desktop environments.
3. The program browses only for picture files in the given directory. It could be improved to
	recursively browse into deeper folders for picture files
4. Program randomly chooses a wallpaper. A sequential wallpaper selection can be implemented
5. A context menu addition can be added to change the wallpaper.
6. Creating an installer using bash or python (2.x /3.x)
7. Porting the program to python 2.x language.(Presently in 3.x)
